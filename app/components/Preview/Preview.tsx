     Ever wanted to know more about Sushi? Sushi originated as a means of preserving fish by
     fermenting it in rice. Many people believe it is Japanese however, it was actually first seen
     in China in the 2nd Century AD. It wasnâ€™t until the 8th century AD that it reached Japan.
     Originally this fermented rice was discarded and the fish was consumed, this became a great
     source of protein and the fish was full of Omega 3 oils.
